# p4-ipv6-switch-ml
This paper was presented at the 2019 P4 Worship at Stanford:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06701.pdf

The paper implemented switch ML using IPv4 broadcast messages.
I had to write a new IETF draft to extend switch ML to use IPv6: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hsingh-ipv6-coin-ml/

The p4-16 code in this repo supports the above draft.

More details TODO.
